Weekly meeting:
  We will have a meeting every week on Monday after Software until 2:00pm. The time for meeting can change if we find a time that 
  works better for everyone. We will most likely have to have additional meetings later on as the amount of work ramps up throughout the 
  semester.
  
Git:
  Play around on here to learn how Git works if you don't know already, as we will be using it to maintain all of our code, 
  documentation, etc...

Current objectives:
  - Find and agree on a software application that a client wants (waiting on Katie's dad atm)
  - Create the project website, or some other way to maintain the collection of meeting minutes (could even use github)
