    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p> The intent of our proposed software, currently referred to as the Universal Raffle Management System, is to provide a system that an organization may use to facilitate the sale of tickets and simplify management for a raffle. The pursuit for this type of system stemmed from the troubles faced by our client while managing their raffle. The current procedure used by our client is to extract buyer information from a paper ticket, and manually input this information into a spreadsheet. This manual inputting of information leads to information inconsistency. Presently, our client stores ticket and seller information across various spreadsheets. This variety of storage locations causes unnecessary complexity within their current system. The sale of their tickets spans a large area, and some communities in this area are fairly rural and distant. This makes it difficult for our client to deliver paper tickets to these communities. It was for these reasons, as well as others, that our client sought to find a new system that allows the sale of digital tickets in addition to the conventional physical tickets, and that provides better organization and analysis of their raffle. </p>
